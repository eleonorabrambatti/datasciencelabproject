Time series forecast for restaurant dataset

The report describes the steps taken to carry out the Data Science Lab project. The project consists in analysing historical data concerning daily restaurant sales from a period of time spanning from the beginning of 2018 until the beginning of May 2023 for six establishments. The goal of the project is to estimate the optimal forecasting model for the rest of the 2023 year for each one of them. Since it is paramount that the data present trends in time and for them not to be influenced by anomalous events, a determining date from when to consider the starting point of the analysis was established. We first implemented simple ARIMA models, from the 2nd to the 6th order, followed by ARIMAX models with and without dummy variables. Finally, we resorted to Machine Learning models such as KNN, LSTM and
GRU.
